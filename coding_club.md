## R Coding Club for teaching coding, data analysis, and research tools    

### Location  

Emory University  
Atlanta, USA  

### People  

**Matt Malishev, Emory University, USA**    
Desiree de Leon, Emory University, USA    
Hasse Walum, Emory University, USA    

### Tasks   

* Developed and maintained a regular coding club in coding, research tools, and data analysis in `R`  
* Developed take-home, reproducible coding modules for unsupervised learning        

### Outcomes    

* Monthly coding club in `R` at Emory University
* Teaching and mentoring from undergraduate to professor levels        

### Example outputs  

Head directly to the Emory Coding Club website to see all info on session material and lesson modules.

## Individual-based model of closed predator-prey system using game theory rules with full energy and mass conservation       

### Location  

Vrije Universiteit    
Amsterdam, The Netherlands       

### People

**Matt Malishev, Centre of Excellence for Biosecurity Risk Analysis, Australia**    
Bob W. Kooi, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands  
Sebastiaan A.L.M. Kooijman, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands    

### Tasks   

* Developed a metabolic theory-driven individual-based model for hawk (predator) and dove (prey) game theory dynamics in a stochastic predator-prey model. The model integrates individual-level bioenergetics of each trophic level with full energy and mass conservation, i.e. a closed system.       
* Used replicator dynamics to link behavioural states among individuals in the payoff matrix (fast time scale) and an evolutionary stable strategy at the population and community levels (slow time scale).        

### Outcomes  

**Select trait**  

Hawk (p)  
Dove (1 – p)  

**Abilities**  

Dove        
Always share prey with another dove.  

Hawk  
Always beat dove  

If competing with a hawk, you incur a cost, C, and a 0.5 probability of gaining prey, G.  

**Controls on the fast time scale**  

Searching  
Handling  
Fighting
