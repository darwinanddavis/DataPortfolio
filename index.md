# Simulation, spatial, and bioenergetics modeller           

### I like my data diverse, my methods savvy, my analyses reproducible, and my outputs open access   

### Iâ€™m a computational researcher at [Emory University](https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/civitello/) working on diverse data analysis problems from simulation modelling of human disease risk to spatial and biophysical modelling of ecological systems.  

### The header tabs give a snapshot of some of my computational work. Below are links to my digital footprint.
