Fentanyl, a new immobilizing compound proved to be safe and effective for gemsbok. The gemsbok were chased on the interdune plains and darted from a Land Rover with the Palmer powder-charge Cap-Chur gun. A 6-seater helicopter was used on a trial basis to dart gemsbok but it is suggested that a small more maneuvrable helicopter be used for further operations. All the gemsbok were transported under narcosis from the capture area to an enclosure. Chlorpromazine hydrochloride was injected into the captured gemsbok to sedate them in their new confined environment. Tranquilizers such as chlorpromazine hydrochloride, acetylpromazine maleate and a new tranquilizer SU-9064 were used to sedate the animals during long distance transportation in crates. This prevented the animals from injuring themselves and damaging the crates. For the 1st time in South West Africa wild animals were transported by air. A journey by road which under normal circumstances would have taken over 40 h was completed in less than 9 h by air. There were no losses during transportation and only 2 gemsbok were injured during the translocation operation."			<Go to ISI>://BCI:BCI197763001378

The microscopic agglutination (MA) test was used and titers to L. interrogans serovar hardjo antigen were detected in 33.5% of 352 brushtailed possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) samples in several Victoria areas. Reactor prevalence ranged from 14-66% in 4 populations. L. interrogans serovar balcanica was isolated from possums with L. interrogans serovar hardjo Ab from 2 different areas. Of 20 wombats (Vombatus ursinus) examined in Victoria, Ab to L. interrogans serovar hardjo were found in sera from 4 and titers to pyrogenes and pomona serogroups were detected in another. L. interrogans serovar hardjo Ab were demonstrated in sera from 13 of 19 rusa deer (Cervus timorensis). Negative MA test results to L. interrogans serovar hardjo antigens were recorded in 55 mountain possums (T. caninus), 63 macropods (Macropus spp.), 17 water rats (Hydromys chrysogaster), 39 fallow deer (Dama dama), 2 hog deer (Axis porcinus) and 2 water buffalo (Bubalus bubalus). No MA Ab to any of 16 leptospiral serogroups were detected in 17 water rats tested.

Thus a modified ELISA procedure to detect antibodies in the sera of animals (Dama dama) living in farm conditions in a field station was investigated. Two groups of animals were formed: Group I consisting of 15 hinds naturally infected with Neospora caninum, and Group II consisting of 15 uninfected hinds.In Group I, eleven offspring were born in 2013, another nine in 2014, and eight in 2015. In Group II, 14 offspring were born in 2013, 13 in 2014 and 13 in 2015. All offspring in Group II were seronegative against N. caninum. Significantly fewer offspring were born from seropositive hinds (p < 0.05). Infected hinds (Group I) gave 21.4%, 30.8% and 38.5% fewer offspring than uninfected hinds (Group II) in the years 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, not all offspring born in Group I were seropositive. The overall vertical transmission ratio of N. caninum in naturally infected fallow deer achieved 82.1% (63.6% in 2013, 100% in 2014 and 67.8% in 2015).This is the first study identifying the impact of the parasite on fallow deer productivity according to a significant reduction in birth rate. And also suggest that, naturally N. caninum infected buck does not appear to transmit infection to the hinds by natural fertilization."

All deer were observed antemortem and seemed to be blind. Post-mortem examination revealed gross lesions of bilateral keratoconjunctivitis and/or panophthalmitis in the first two deer, but only partial retinal detachment in the third deer. Microscopically, all deer had moderate-to-severe necrotizing and fibrinopurulent endophthalmitis and varying degrees of keratoconjunctivitis with abundant intralesional coccobacilli. The lesions in the first (D1) and third deer (D3) suggested an acute course, whereas those in the second deer (D2) were subacute to chronic. Yersinia pestis was isolated from ocular tissue swabs or ocular fluids of D1 and D2, and it was demonstrated by, immunohistochemistry within ocular lesions of D1 and D3. Although plague does not seem to be a major cause of morbidity or mortality in free-ranging mule deer, keratoconjunctivitis or pinkeye is relatively common in these animals and plague should be considered as a differential diagnosis in such cases, with appropriate precautions taken to protect the human and animal health."			<Go to ISI>://BCI:BCI200900066042

We used an individually based epidemiological model to assess the relative efficacies of three management interventions (sterilization, vaccination, and test-and-remove). The model was parameterized with demographic and epidemiological data from bison in Yellowstone National Park, USA. Sterilization and test-and-remove were most successful at reducing seroprevalence when they were targeted at young seropositive animals, which are the most likely age and sex category to be infectious. However, these approaches also required the most effort to implement. Vaccination was less effective (even with a perfect vaccine) but also required less effort to implement. For the treatment efforts we explored (50-100 individuals per year or 2.5-5% of the female population), sterilization had little impact upon the bison population growth rate when selectively applied. The population growth rate usually increased by year 25 due to the reduced number of Brucella-induced abortions. Initial declines in seroprevalence followed by rapid increases (>= 15% increase in 5 years) occurred in 3-13% of simulations with sterilization and test-and-remove, but not vaccination. We believe this is due to the interaction of superspreading events and the loss of herd immunity in the later stages of control efforts as disease prevalence declines. Sterilization provided a mechanism for achieving large disease reductions while simultaneously limiting population growth, which may be advantageous in some management scenarios. However, the field effort required to find the small segment of the population that is infectious rather than susceptible or recovered will likely limit the utility of this approach in many free-ranging wildlife populations. Nevertheless, we encourage scientists and policy makers to consider sterilization as part of a suite of available brucellosis management tools."	"Cross, Paul/K-6987-2012"

Wild-caught Glossina palpalis gambiensis were transferred singly into small numbered cages and allowed to feed on 14 uninfected N'Dama cattle. Following a completed feed the tsetse were dissected and infection in the proboscis, the salivary glands and the gut was recorded. Each animal was bitten by a number of tsetse ranging from five up to 64 flies. Following dissection of the tsetse flies, seven of the cattle were found to have been bitten by a single infected tsetse, five by two, while the remaining two were each fed upon by three infected tsetse. The tsetse were harbouring either Trypanosoma vivax or a trypanosome species belonging to the Nannomonas subgenus or both species. The experimental animals were monitored daily over a period of three months for the appearance of trypanosomes in the blood and for antibodies in their sera. Other parameters such as body temperature, local skin reactions, packed red cell volume and weight changes were also measured. Trypanosomes were first detected eight days after the infective bite. Only five of the 14 cattle became infected, of which three had been exposed to a single infected tsetse fly. Trypanosoma vivax was detected in one animal, Trypanosoma congolense in two cattle and mixed infections of both species in the remaining two animals. These findings show that N'Dama cattle can become infected with trypanosomes through the bite of a single infected tsetse fly under field conditions. However, only five (possibly eight) of the 23 infected tsetse were able to transmit the parasites successfully."			<Go to ISI>://BCI:BCI199090007044

All inoculated cattle became parasitaemic. Zebus showed consistently higher levels of parasitaemia and lower packed red cell volume (PCV) percentages than did N'Damas. Three of the eight zebus required treatment when high numbers of trypanosomes were present in the blood and PCV values dropped below 15 per cent. None of the N'Dama cattle needed treatment. Statistical analysis was performed on the data to assess the variability of parasitaemia and PCV levels before and during infection of the N'Dama cattle. The variation in PCV values was large between individuals during the early stages of the disease and diminished as infection continued. After trypanocidal drug treatment and a recovery period of 14 months, the same animals were inoculated intradermally with T. congolense bloodstream forms isolated and cloned in The Gambia. Differences in susceptibility to the ensuing disease were apparent when comparing N'Dama and zebu cattle. Five zebu cattle needed trypanocidal drug treatment, while none of the N'Dama needed drug intervention. Ranking the 20 infected N'Damas according to average PCV levels revealed that the animals responded similarly to both infections."			<Go to ISI>://BCI:BCI199294042936

Large knowledge gaps exist, however, relating to reservoirs, vectors, and transmission of these bacteria. We describe identification by culture, PCR, and housekeeping gene sequencing of Bartonella spp. in fed, wingless deer keds (Lipoptena cervi), deer ked pupae, and blood samples collected from moose, Alces alces, sampled within the deer ked distribution range in Norway. Direct sequencing from moose blood sampled in a deer ked-free area also indicated Bartonella infection but at a much lower prevalence. The sequencing data suggested the presence of mixed infections involving two species of Bartonella within the deer ked range, while moose outside the range appeared to be infected with a single species. Bartonella were not detected or cultured from unfed winged deer keds. The results may indicate that long-term bacteremia in the moose represents a reservoir of infection and that L. cervi acts as a vector for the spread of infection of Bartonella spp. Further research is needed to evaluate the role of L. cervi in the transmission of Bartonella to animals and humans and the possible pathogenicity of these bacteria for humans and animals."

As part of that study, blood, fecal, and tissue samples from 104 neonatal fawns, 40 adult does, and nine adult male pronghorns were collected to conduct a health evaluation of the population. Physiological parameters related to nutrition and/or disease were studied. No abnormalities were found in the complete blood cell counts of adults (n = 40) or fawns (n = 44 to 67). Serum total protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were lower compared to other pronghorn populations. Does had mean BUN values significantly lower (P < 0.001) in December 1996 than March 1997. Serum copper (Cu) levels in does (range 0.39 to 0.74 ppm) were considered marginal when compared to domestic animals and other wild ungulates. Fawns had low (0.28 ppm) Cu levels at birth and reached the does' marginal values in about 3 days. Whole blood, serum and liver selenium (Se) levels were considered marginal to low in most segments of the pronghorn population. However, serum levels of vitamin E (range 1.98 to 3.27 mug/ml), as determined from the does captured in March, were apparently sufficient to offset any signs of Se deficiency. No clinical signs of Cu or Se deficiency were observed. Fifty-five of 87 dead fawns were necropsied. Trauma, due to predation by coyotes (Canis latrans), accounted for 62% of the mortality during mid-May to mid-July of each year. Other causes included predation by golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) (4%), dystocia (2%), septicemic pasteurellosis (4%), starvation (5%), and unknown (23%). Adult females were tested for serum neutralizing antibodies to Brucella spp. (n = 20, negative), Leptospira interrogans (n = 20, negative), bluetongue virus (n = 20, 35% positive), epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (n = 20, 30% positive), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 18, negative), parainfluenza virus type 3 (n = 18, 67% positive), infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (n = 18, negative), and bovine viral diarrhea (n = 18, negative). Considering the parameters examined, we found no apparent predisposing factors to mortality including those killed by coyotes, but some nutritional parameters suggest that pronghorns on HMNAR exist on a diet low in protein and Se and marginal in Cu. The effect these factors have on the population is not known."	"Velarde, Roser/M-1614-2014"

Birds were captured and released on two study areas during 1999-2001; Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR) in northwestern Nevada, and Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge (HMNAR) in southeastern Oregon. Birds from a third study area, Beaty's Butte grazing allotment (BB) in southeastern Oregon, were sampled in 2000 and 2001. Overall, 19 birds (10%) were positive for Leucocytozoon lovati (=L. bonasae), 1 (0.5%) for Plasmodium pedioecetii, and 2 (1%) for microfilariae. Although prevalence of L. lovati on HMNAR was 39% during the breeding season in 1999 and 100% during the brood-rearing season in 2000, statistically, prevalence of L. lovati among study areas and years was not different. However, there were statistical differences between capture periods. Overall, 31% of the hens were positive for L. lovati during the brood-rearing season compared to 6% during the breeding season. There was no difference in packed cell volume between infected and non-infected birds and no difference between age-classes. However, mean sage-grouse productivity on HMNAR was higher (1.6 chicks/hen) for non-infected (n=10) compared to infected hens (0.7 chicks/hen; n=7), during 1999.

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) caused by FMD virus (FMDV) is a severe, highly communicable viral disease of cloven-hoofed animals, including both domestic and wild ruminants. Early detection of the disease may reduce economic loss and loss of susceptible wildlife. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of IRT to detect possible heat changes associated with sites of infection with FMDV in experimentally infected mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). Infection occurred through either inoculation with FMDV or exposure to inoculated animals. Early vesicular lesions were observed on the mouth, feet, or both within 24 hrs postinoculation and 48-96 hrs post-exposure. From internal temperature sensors, the exposed animals' body temperatures elevated significantly from the pre-infection temperature (38.8 degrees C, P <= 0.002) starting the day before any lesions were observed. Body temperature was also found not to be significantly different from eye temperatures of well-focused thermograms. For feet thermograms, the mean of the daily maximum (MMAX) foot temperature rose significantly (P = 0.017) from two days before (27.3 degrees C +/- 1.9 degrees C SE) to the maximum MMAX observed (33.0 degrees C +/- 2.0 degrees C SE) at two days after the first foot lesion occurrence. These observed changes indicate that IRT may be a rapid, remote, and noninvasive method to screen for suspect animals in order to test further for FMDV infection during an FMD outbreak."			<Go to ISI>://BCI:BCI200900423600

We recorded 84 cases of moose showing typical signs of infection by the meningeal worm, 61 during the 1983-1992 period. There was close agreement between deer distribution and the location of symptomatic Moose. Signs of infection with the meningeal worm appeared equally between sexes in animals older than 1 year of age, but symptomatic calves were observed less often than expected. We found a significant linear relationship (r-2 = 0.80; d.f. = 8) between apparent infection rate (observed cases-10 000 moose-1 cntdot yr-1) and estimated deer density. At the scale of hunting zones, we found no evidence of refugia in which moose would be protected from the parasite. Reported cases of symptomatic moose always represented less than 1% of total moose populations; monitoring of 149 radio-collared moose in two areas of southern Deer densities are probably not high enough to prevent the establishment of Moose populations anywhere in Quebec. This limiting factor, however, diminishes the demographic vigour of infected populations, and the potential hunting harvest."			<Go to ISI>://BCI:BCI199799407272

Although effects on mule deer survival are clear, how CWD affects recruitment is less certain. We studied how prion infection influenced the number of offspring raised to weaning per adult (>= 2 yr old) female mule deer and subsequently the estimated growth rate (lambda) of an infected deer herd. Infected and presumably uninfected radio-collared female deer were observed with their fawns in late summer (August September) during three consecutive years (2006-2008) in the Table Mesa area of Boulder, Colorado, USA. We counted the number of fawns accompanying each female, then used a fully Bayesian model to estimate recruitment by infected and uninfected females and the effect of the disease on lambda. On average, infected females wearied 0.95 fawns (95% credible interval=0.56-1.43) whereas uninfected females weaned 1.34 fawns (95% credible interval=1.09-1.61); the probability that uninfected females weaned more fawns than infected females was 0.93). We used estimates of prevalence to weight recruitment and survival parameters in the transition matrix of a three-age, single-sex matrix model and then used the matrix to calculate effects of CWD on lambda. When effects of CWD on both survival and recruitment were included, the modeled lambda was 0.97 (95% credible interval = 0.82-1.09). Effects of disease on lambda were mediated almost entirely by elevated mortality of infected animals. We conclude that although CWD may affect mule deer recruitment, these effects seem to be sufficiently small that they can be omitted in estimating the influences of CWD on population growth rate."

A total of 230 outbreaks of FMD at sub-district level were recorded in 299 villages located in 19 out of the 20 districts in the country. There were no significant differences between the years (P=0.998) or months (P=0.989) on the incidence of FMD. The sub-districts in the north (altitude > 1,000 m above mean sea level) had significantly (P=0.008) higher incidences of outbreaks in winter than in summer. The sub-districts that shared border with India had significantly more outbreaks than those that didn't (P=0.001). Cattle were the most predominant species affected being involved in all of the outbreaks reported. Serotype O, which constituted 70.6% of the outbreaks typed was the most predominant serotype prevalent in Bhutan followed by A (16.7%), Asia 1 (8.8%), and C (3.9%). Cattle density was significantly positively correlated (P=0.023) with the incidence of disease. Three waves of outbreaks of epidemic proportions were reported in 1997/1998, 2002/2003, and 2007/2008 due to the PanAsia strain of the O serotype. The study highlights the incursion of the PanAsia strain of the O serotype into the country, possibly, through the transboundary movement of animals and the need for active surveillance of FMD, especially at the border areas. The study also highlights the significance of the O serotype and cattle as the main indicator species in the epidemiology of FMD in Bhutan.

The goal of this study was to determine the geographic distribution of A. phagocytophilum among WTD across a 19 state region and to evaluate the utility of WTD as natural sentinels. Serologic testing using the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay was conducted on WTD serum samples and molecular and xenodiagnostic tests were performed to confirm serologic results. The surveillance system was assessed through examination of vital attributes including WTD age and gender associations with serologic status, sample size adequacy for accurate infection status classification, and presence of the vector, I. scapularis. Six hundred thirty-three of 2,666 (24%) WTD in 17 states tested positive for antibodies (2:128) when tested by IFA assay. Testing for p44 and/or 16S rRNA gene targets identified 73 (16%) PCR positive WTD among 458 animals tested, all of which originated from seropoisitive populations. Attempts to culture A. phagocytophilum from WTD were unsuccessful; however, xenodiagnostic mice inoculated with blood from 3 WTD became infected. Seroprevalence did not differ by deer age or gender; however, WTD <= 0.75 years old had a higher prevalence of PCR positivity. Using seroprevalence data, a sample size of 6-9 animals per population was projected to be adequate for identifying seropositive populations. The presence of I. scapularis was significantly associated with A. phagocytophilum antibodies in WTD. Collectively, the results of this study demonstrate that WTD would be suitable natural sentinels tot this emerging zoonotic pathogen."	"Mead, Daniel/F-7501-2013"		<Go to ISI>://BCI:BCI200600387005

Spatial models that quantify risk-driven differences in resource selection and hunter mortality of animals at fine spatial scales can assist disease management by identifying high-risk areas and individuals. We used resource selection functions (RSFs) and selection ratios (SRs) to quantify sex- and age-specific resource selection patterns of collared (n=67) and hunter-killed (n=796) nonmigratory elk (Cervus canadensis manitobensis) during the hunting season between 2002 and 2012, in southwestern Manitoba, Canada. Distance to protected area was the most important covariate influencing resource selection and hunter-kill sites of elk (AICw=1.00). Collared adult males (which are most likely to be infected with bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis) and chronic wasting disease) rarely selected for sites outside of parks during the hunting season in contrast to adult females and juvenile males. The RSFs showed selection by adult females and juvenile males to be negatively associated with landscape-level forest cover, high road density, and water cover, whereas hunter-kill sites of these cohorts were positively associated with landscape-level forest cover and increasing distance to streams and negatively associated with high road density. Local-level forest was positively associated with collared animal locations and hunter-kill sites; however, selection was stronger for collared juvenile males and hunter-killed adult females. In instances where disease infects a metapopulation and eradication is infeasible, a principle goal of management is to limit the spread of disease among infected animals. We map high-risk areas that are regularly used by potentially infectious hosts but currently underrepresented in the distribution of kill sites. We present a novel application of widely available data to target hunter distribution based on host resource selection and kill sites as a promising tool for applying selective hunting to the management of transmissible diseases in a game species."

Experimental exposures included a combination of one or more of Elaphostrongylus cervi, Dictyocaulus sp., and Muellerius capillaris. The prepatent period of E. cervi infections was 92-133 days post exposure (dpe) in 12 deer each given 20-42 infective larvae (L3) and maintained under controlled conditions. Adult E. cervi were recovered from all 12 animals at necropsy. The prepatent period of Dictyocaulus sp. was 23-37 dpe in 10 deer each given 100 L3 and maintained under controlled conditions. Adult Dictyocaulus sp. were recovered from seven animals at necropsy. No animal exposed to 42-54 M. capillaris L3 developed patent infections, nor were adult worms recovered at necropsy. There was no evidence of neurologic signs in any deer at any time during the experiment. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using somatic protein extracts of adult E. cervi or those from the closely related nematode Parelaphostrongylus tenuis was evaluated. Although the ELISA was sensitive, it lacked specificity with heterologous infections.

This parasite is the causative agent of a debilitating neurologic disease in atypical hosts, including domestic livestock. In order to identify proteins of potential significance in the host-parasite relationship, a cDNA library was produced from adult P. tenuis mRNA. Screening the library with antisera from infected red deer (Cervus elaphus elaphus) and immunized AO strain rats, we identified clones with sequence similarities to aspartyl protease inhibitors from several parasitic nematodes. Antibody that was generated against this recombinant protein of P. tenuis (Pt-API-1) detected the native protein in E/S products, in muscle and gonad, and on the surface of the cuticle of adult male and female P. tenuis. The native protein was detected in internal structures of first-stage (L1) and third-stage (L3) larvae. Reverse transcription-PCR confirmed expression of Pt-api-1 in L1, L3, and adult male and female worms. Expression of Pt-API-1 throughout the life cycle of P. tenuis suggests an essential function. Antibodies specific for recombinant Pt-API-1 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in sera from 12 red deer experimentally infected with P. tenuis. Antibodies were detected within 28 to 56 days postinfection. Responses were sustained or biphasic in animals with patent infections, consistent with expression of Pt-API-1 by L1. Our results are compatible with findings in other parasitic nematodes showing that aspartyl protease inhibitors are highly immunogenic."			<Go to ISI>://BCI:BCI200200448820

Parelaphostrongylus tenuis L1 were collected from feces of an experimentally infected white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We utilized two red deer (Cervus elaphus) and four laboratory rats (Rattus norvegicus) which were each fed the L1 of P. tenuis. Larvae were recovered, intact and alive, from the fecal samples of all six animals. Larvae of P. tenuis, and probably of other related species, can survive passage through the alimentary canal of uninfected mammals and they can be collected from feces using the Baermann technique and other related larval extraction methods. Rain water was found to be successful in the dispersal of P. tenuis L1 from the feces of infected animals. These findings raise the possibility of ingestion of L1 and their subsequent passage, by uninfected animals.

Groups of deer were fed 10, 25, or 100 third-stage larvae (L3) of P. tenuis and received a single equivalent challenge exposure at varying intervals. Infections were monitored up to 6 yr in white-tailed deer and up to 2.8 yr in red deer. The prepatent period in white-tailed deer varied from 9 1 to 1,072 days (381 +/- 374) and in red deer from 105 to 358 days (167 +/- 77). Adult worms lived for up to 6 yr in white-tailed deer. Although most had patent infections until necropsy, latent periods were observed regardless of season. Adult worms lived for up to 2.8 yr in red deer, and patent infections persisted for 20-363 days (152 +/- 106). Patent infections were correlated with the presence of adult worms in blood vessels and sinuses of both deer species. Worms were restricted to the subdural space in all deer with latent and occult infections. Adult worm recovery in white-tailed deer fed 10 or 25 L3 corresponded to the mean intensities reported in natural infections of white-tailed deer. Recovery from deer fed 100 L3 was not typical of natural infection intensities. Adult P. tenuis established in all groups of red deer, but neurologic disease was restricted to animals fed 100 L3. Acute neurologic disease was associated with subdural hemorrhage and occurred at 11 mo postinfection in 2 red deer. The absence of postchallenge patent periods and the persistence of occult infections indicated that challenge exposures did not establish. These data indicate that acquired immunity to P. tenuis was established by 6 mo postinfection in both white-tailed and red deer.

Excretory-secretory (E-S) antigens from adult P. tenuis were evaluated for their serodiagnostic potential in identifying P. tenuis and heterologous E. cervi infections in a Western blot. The antigen recognition profile of sera from animals infected with P. tenuis varied between individuals and with duration of infections, whereas that of pooled sera from animals infected with E. cervi showed less variation. A single molecule of 42-43 kDa was recognized consistently by sera from all animals infected with either P. tenuis or E. cervi. Sera from unexposed control deer and from those with other heterologous nematode infections did not consistently identify this antigen. Serorecognition of the 42-43-kDa antigen by deer infected with P. tenuis resulted in a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 85% (gtoreq1 mo postinfection). Although antibody to this antigen waned with time, the persistence of recognition up to 34 mo postinfection with P. tenuis exemplifies its diagnostic value. The sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis using this molecule were each 100% for identifying deer infected with E. cervi (gtoreq3 mo postinfection). Two other molecules from E-S of adult P. tenuis, 26-28 and 10-12 kDa, were also diagnostic, although their recognition was not persistent throughout infections. These 2 molecules may prove useful in combination with the 42-43-kDa antigen to help identify all infected animals during all phases of infections. This research represents the first conclusive identification of antigens with real potential for reliable antemortem immunodiagnosis of both P. tenuis infections and heterologous E. cervi infections."			<Go to ISI>://BCI:BCI200200414483

We evaluated variables associated with B. tarandi prevalence and cyst density with the use of barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus) from two migratory herds in northern Quebec: the Riviere-aux-Feuilles and the Riviere-George herds. Diagnosis of infection was made upon the microscopic observation of characteristic cysts in a formalin-fixed section of skin from the anterior aspect of the metatarsus. The density of cysts (number of B. tarandi cysts/mm(2)) was calculated in a section of the dermis extending from the epidermis of the skin to the base of the hair follicles and adnexal structures. Statistically significant associations between B. tarandi prevalence and cyst density, sex, age, and time of harvest were observed. Male caribou had a slightly higher prevalence compared to females, whereas cyst densities were similar between sexes. We found a nonlinear increase in the odds of infection by B. tarandi by age combined with the opposite trend for intensity of infection. Higher B. tarandi prevalence was observed in caribou sampled in the fall compared to June of the same year, suggesting that transmission is increased during the summer. Higher densities of cysts observed during the fall compared to June of the following year may be the result of the elimination of B. tarandi cysts from the dermis during the winter, or lower winter survival of heavily infected caribou.

Sampled tissues consisted of the conjunctiva of the left eye and skin sections from the rostrum, metatarsus, and thigh from 312 harvested caribou. Diagnosis of infection with B. tarandi was based on observation of at least one cyst by microscopic examination. For each tissue, the maximal density of cysts (number of B. tarandi cysts/mm(2) in the section examined) was calculated for a measured area consisting of the dermis extending from the epidermis of the skin to the base of the hair follicles and adnexal structures. For the conjunctiva, the entire submucosa was evaluated.

Recent censuses in the 1980s have allowed us to test the hypotheses that: (1) there was competition between wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) and Thomson's gazelle (Gazella thomsoni). This predicted that gazelle numbers should have declined in the 1980s when wildebeest were food limited. Census figures show no change in gazelle numbers between 1978 and 1986, a result contrary to the interspecific competition hypothesis; (2) wildebeest and African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) populations were regulated by intraspecific competition for food. Since both populations reached food limitation in the 1970s, the hypothesis predicted that the populations should have been stable in the 1980s. The results confirm these predictions for wildebeest and the buffalo population in the Mara reserve. In the Serengeti the buffalo population declined 41% over the period 1976-1984. The decline was not evenly distributed over the park, some areas showing an 80-90% decline, others no change or an increase in numbers. The decline was associated with proximity to human habitation; (3) an outbreak of the viral disease, rinderpest, in 1982 may have been the cause of the drop in buffalo population. Blood serum samples to measure the prevalence of antibodies were collected from areas of decreasing, stable and increasing populations. If rinderpest was the cause of decrease there should be a negative relationship between the prevalence of rinderpest and the instantaneous rate of increase (r). The results showed no relationship. We conclude that rinderpest was not the major cause of the drop in buffalo numbers. Elephant (Loxodonta africana) numbers dropped 81% in Serengeti in the period 1977-1986. In the Mara there was little change. The evidence suggests that extensive poaching in northern and western Serengeti during 1979-1984 accounted for the drop in both elephant and buffalo numbers."

However, still little is known of the genetic diversity of this parasite circulating in wildlife. In the present study, we tested coyotes (Canis latrans), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and geese (Branta canadensis) from the state of Pennsylvania for T. gondii infection. Antibodies to T. gondii were found in 160 of 367 animals, including 92 (34.5%) of 266 coyotes, 49 (62.0%) of 79 white-tailed deer, 17 (85.0%) of 20 red fox, and two of two Canada geese tested by the modified agglutination test (cut off titer 1:25). Tissues from 105 seropositive animals were bioassayed in mice, and viable T. gondii was isolated from 29 animals, including 10 of 53 coyotes, 11 of 16 foxes, 7 of 49 deer, and one of one goose. DNA isolated from culture-derived tachyzoites of these isolates was characterized initially using multilocus PCR-RFLP markers. Nine genotypes were revealed, including ToxoDB PCR-RFLP #1(4 isolates), #2 (2 isolates), #3 (4 isolates), #4(6 isolates), #5 (4 isolates), #54 (1 isolate), #141 (1 isolate), #143 (1 isolate), and #216 (6 isolates), indicating high genetic diversity of T. gondii in wildlife in Pennsylvania. Pathogenicity of six T. gondii isolates (5 of #216 and #141) was determined in outbred Swiss Webster mice. Three of #216 and the #141 isolates were acute virulent to mice, and the other 2 #216 isolates were intermediate virulent. To determine the extent of genetic variation of these as well as a few recently reported virulent isolates from wildlife in North America, intron sequences were generated. Analysis of intron sequences and PCR-RFLP genotyping results indicated that the #216 isolates are likely derived from recombination of the clonal type I and III lineages. To determine if T. gondii virulence can be predicted by typing, we genotyped a collection of strains using PCR-RFLP markers for polymorphic genes ROP5, ROP16, ROP18 and GRA15, which are known to interact with host immune response.

Infectivity of its tissue cysts, bradyzoites, and tachyzoites to animals and cell culture was studied. The bradyzoites and tissue cysts were not infectious to out-bred mice, rabbits or gerbils. When fed tissue cysts, neither cats nor dogs excreted oocysts. However, the parasite was lethal to interferon-gamma gene knock out mice irrespective of the route of inoculation. The parasite was grown successfully in African Green Monkey cells from tissues of two reindeer for the first time. Non-dividing, uninucleate tachyzoites from smears from cell cultures were 5.6 x 1.4 mum (4.5-7.4 x 1.0-1.9, n = 50) in size. Longitudinally-cut bradyzoites in tissue sections measured 7.4 x 1.3 mum (6.5-7.8 x 1.0-1.6, n = 30). Ultrastructurally, tachyzoites and bradyzoites were similar to those in other Besnoitia species, and in particular to parasites described from cattle (Besnoitia besnoiti) and equids (Besnoitia bennetti) in that their bradyzoites lacked enigmatic bodies. Based on comparative analysis of three portions of nuclear ribosomal DNA (the small and large subunits and the first internal transcribed spacer) B. tarandi was found to be more closely related to the other congeners described from ungulates. The parasite was formally redescribed and specimens deposited in the US National Parasite Collection. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Australian Society for Parasitology Inc."

Antibody seroconversion in glycoprotein E (gE) blocking ELISA during BuHV-1 infection has been documented. Recent diagnostic efforts have focused on the development and application of discriminatory tests to distinguish between infections with BoHV-1 and BuHV-1.Objective: To evaluate the impact and distribution of these two infections in water buffalo farms in two regions (Piedmont (n = 3) and Campania (n = 10), Italy) where infectious bovine rhinotracheitis control programs have been implemented.Animals and methods: Sampling was carried out on 13 buffalo farms comprising 1089 animals using specific gE-indirect ELISA's test able to discriminate among BoHV-1 and BuHV-1 infections.Results: 59.0% of animals reacted positive to ELISA (irrespective of whether BoHV-1 or BuHV-1 antigen was used) and 86.4% of these were reactive to BuHV-1 only, whereas 11.8% showed absorbance values for both antigens and were classified as inconclusive. There was a statistically significant age-related difference in BuHV-1 infection rates but not in overall individual (47% vs. 58%) or herd prevalence (100% vs. 90%) of infection between the two regions.Conclusion: The low percentage of sera reactive to BoHV-1 (1.8%, 12/643) indicates that BuHV-1 may be the main circulating alphaherpesvirus infection in Mediterranean water buffalo in the two study areas. Since Bubalus bubalis is included in Directive 64/432/EEC on animal health problems affecting intra-community trade in bovine animals, diagnostic testing with nonspecific ELISA for BoHV-1 infection in buffalo may yield false-positive reactions. This scenario could lead to economic losses and hamper buffalo trade and movement, particularly for reproduction purposes."	"Vecchio, Domenico/0000-0002-8766-7224"		<Go to ISI>://BCI:BCI201700044006

Public tolerance can exert a significant effect on potential control measures available to managers, and thus on the success of disease management efforts. Separate outbreaks of bTB in free-ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in two midwestern states provide a case study.In Minnesota, bTB was first discovered in cattle in 2005 and subsequently in deer. To date, 12 beef cattle farms and 26 white-tailed deer have been found infected with the disease. From 2005 to 2008, disease prevalence in deer has decreased from 0.4% (SE = 0.2%) to <0.1% and remained confined to a small (<425 km(2)) geographic area. Deer population reduction through liberalized hunting and targeted culling by ground sharpshooting and aerial gunning, combined with a prohibition on baiting and recreational feeding, have likely been major drivers preventing disease spread thus far. Without support from cattle producers, deer hunters and the general public, as well as politicians, implementation of these aggressive strategies by state and federal authorities would not have been possible.In contrast, Michigan first discovered bovine bTB in free-ranging deer in 1975, and disease management efforts were not instituted until 1995. The first infected cattle herd was diagnosed in 1998. Since 1995, disease prevalence in free-ranging deer has decreased from 4.9% to 1.8% in the similar to 1500 km(2) core outbreak area. Culture positive deer have been found as far as 188 km from the core area. Liberalized harvest and restrictions on baiting and feeding have facilitated substantial reductions in prevalence. However, there has been little support on the part of hunters, farmers or the general public for more aggressive population reduction measures such as culling, and compliance with baiting and feeding restrictions has been variable and often problematic.We compare and contrast the Minnesota and Michigan outbreaks with respect to temporal, social, economic, and logistical factors that shape public attitudes toward aggressive disease control strategies, the limitations these factors place on management, and the implications for bTB eradication from wildlife reservoirs in the U.S. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this paper is to describe (i) the use of extensive farm resources by wildlife and livestock and (ii) the factors involved. Camera traps (CTs) were placed at a priori risk points (n = 149 points, 2145 CT days) for interspecies interactions: water points, buildings, food points, and acorn fields (which also provide rich pasture), on 11 representative extensive beef cattle (n = 6) and Iberian pig (n = 5) farms. The use of extensive farm resources by wild ungulates was frequent and widespread throughout the study area (over 50 % of daily presence per farm of either wild boar Sus scrofa or red deer Cervus elaphus). This presence increased when there was a high abundance of wild ungulates on nearby hunting estates. No direct interactions were detected, and livestock and wild ungulates partitioned resource use temporally, signifying that the interaction was mainly indirect. The wild species that used all farm resources with by far the most frequency was red deer, although its presence decreased markedly when far from woodland edges. The presence of cattle was positively associated with that of wild boar at all the CTs and specifically with red deer at water points and in acorn fields. Pig presence was negatively associated with that of wild boar, suggesting the existence of competence-mediated avoidance. We propose that interactions at the wildlife-livestock interfaces could be reduced by carrying out specific actions adapted to Mediterranean conditions and farm management: removing and segregating access to risky water points, the wise management of grazing in space and time, and protecting food-rich pasture plots and woodland edges by means of fencing, which is particularly interesting as regards attempting to prevent red deer from accessing areas occupied by livestock and vice versa. Biosecurity programs must be farm-specific, and the effectiveness, costs, and practical value of interventions should be adaptively evaluated in the field in future research."

Therefore the aim of the present study was to investigate the potential role of this ungulate species as a reservoir of human pathogenic strains of A. phagocytophilum in a tick-borne diseases endemic area in Northeastern Italy. Ixodes ricinus feeding on roe deer were collected and analyzed for the presence for A. phagocytophilum by a molecular approach targeting 16S rRNA and groEL genes.

One consequence of the coexistence of wild and domestic herbivores is the risk of pathogen transmission. This risk threatens local livelihoods relying on animal production, public health in the case of zoonoses, national economies in the context of transboundary animal diseases, and the success of integrated conservation and development initiatives. The level of interaction between sympatric wild and domestic hosts, defining different wildlife/livestock interfaces, characterizes opportunities of pathogen transmission between host populations. Exploring the relationship between infection burden and different types of wildlife/domestic interfaces is therefore necessary to manage the sanitary risk in animal populations through control options adapted to these multi-host systems. Here, we assessed the infection burdens of sympatric domestic cattle (Bos taurus/Bos indicus) and African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) at an unfenced interface and compared the infection burdens of cattle populations at different wildlife/livestock interfaces in the Great Limpopo TFCA. Patterns of infection in ungulate populations varied between wild and domestic hosts and between cattle populations at different wildlife/livestock interfaces. Foot-and-mouth disease, Rift Valley fever and theileriosis infections were detected in buffalo and cattle at unfenced interfaces; bovine tuberculosis was only present in buffalo; and brucellosis and lumpy skin disease only in cattle. At unfenced interfaces, cattle populations presented significantly higher Theileria parva and brucellosis prevalence. We hypothesize that cattle populations at wildlife/livestock interfaces face an increased risk of infection compared to those isolated from wildlife, and that the type of interface could influence the diversity and quantity of pathogens shared. Additional host behavioural and molecular epidemiological studies need to be conducted to support this hypothesis. If it is confirmed, the management of wildlife/livestock interfaces will need to be considered through the prism of livestock and public health."

Statistical analyses compared herds of zero, medium (1-40%), and high (>40%) BTB prevalence. To control for ecological variation across the park we collected data in northern, central, and southern regions and restricted some analyses to particular regions of the park. Body condition declined over the course of the 2001 dry season, and buffaloes in the southern region of the park, with the highest BTB prevalence, were in worse condition than buffaloes in the northern region (which receives less annual rainfall but is still virtually BTB-free). Herd-level analyses of the entire park, the south and central regions, and just the southern region all indicated that herds of higher BTB prevalence were in worse condition and lost condition faster through the dry season than herds of lower BTB prevalence. Fecal endoparasite egg counts increased during the dry season and were associated with both decreased body condition and increased BTB prevalence. Although we did not detect any obvious effect of BTB on the age structure of the buffalo population, our findings indicate early symptoms of wider scale BTB-related ecological disturbances: buffalo herds with high BTB prevalence appear more vulnerable to drought (because of a decrease in body condition and an increase in endoparasite load), and because lions selectively kill weak buffaloes their prey base is accumulating a disproportionately high prevalence of BTB, to which lions are susceptible."

Here, we describe the use of a delayed-release anthelmintic delivery system that can be administered when the hosts can be captured and its activity delayed until a more appropriate period in the host-parasite cycle. Our model system is Svalbard reindeer infected with a nematode parasite, Marshallagia marshalli, which appears to accumulate during the Arctic winter. To determine the extent to which this occurs and the effect on host fitness, reindeer need to be treated with anthelmintics in late autumn but they can only be caught and handled in April. To solve this problem, we devised an intra-ruminal capsule that releases the anthelmintic from up to 6 months after being administered. The capsule was trialed in cannulated sheep and red deer to determine optimum capsule orifice size and release rates. Capsules were estimated to release placebo for 100-153 days followed by abamectin for 22-34 days. To test the efficacy of treatment in reindeer, capsules were administered in April and retrieved in October. All capsules had fully released the anthelmintic and treated reindeer had significantly lower worm burdens than controls. Thus, success of this system allows repeated treatment over several years to test the effect of winter parasitism on host fitness."	"Irvine, Robert/G-5074-2012; Wilson, Kenneth/B-7452-2008"

Therefore, in the Arctic, where the winter lasts from October to May, nematode transmission is expected to be focused in the short summer season, yet there is strong evidence that as well as focussing egg output during winter months, the nematode parasite, Marshallagia marshalli, infects Svalbard reindeer during the Arctic winter when temperatures are persistently below freezing. To investigate the potential for development and survival of eggs and infective third-stage larvae in winter and therefore the possibility of for winter transmission, we ran a series of low-temperature laboratory experiments. These provide five key insights into the transmission and survival of the free-living stages of M. marshalli: (1) eggs hatched at temperatures as low as 2 degrees C, but not below 0 degrees C, (2) eggs were viable and developed after being exposed to sub-zero temperatures for up to 28 months, (3) infective-stage larvae survived for up to 80 days at 5 degrees C, (4) infective-stage larvae could survive rapid exposure to temperatures below -30 degrees C, and (5) desiccation resistance may be important for long-term larval survival at low temperatures. Together, these results indicate that eggs deposited during the winter are highly tolerant of prevailing environmental conditions and have the potential for rapid development with the onset of spring. It is therefore likely that the parasite remains in the egg stage in the faeces during the winter of deposition, hatch and develop into the infective larval stage in the summer, remaining viable on the tundra until the reindeer host returns to the winter feeding grounds the following winter."

Campylobacter species were isolated in 55 of 363 (15.2%) faecal samples. Campylobacter was identified in faeces from wild boar (49/126; 38.9%), red deer (5/179; 2.8%) and mouflon (1/13; 7.7%) but not from fallow deer (0/45). The isolated Campylobacter species were identified as C. jejuni (2 isolates; 3.6%), C. coli (11 isolates; 20.0%) and C. lanienae (37 isolates; 67.3%). Five isolates (9.1%) could not be identified at the species level. This report is the first to describe C. lanienae infection in wild ruminant species. Resistance to erythromycin (4.8%), ciprofloxacin (37.5%), tetracycline (52.9%) and streptomycin (55%) were detected. C. lanienae presented a significantly higher number of susceptible isolates to ciprofloxacin and tetracycline than C. coli. Due to the low number of positive wild ruminants, a Generalised Estimating Equations model was only carried out for wild boar. The model indicated that the risk factors associated with Campylobacter infection were the density of wild boar (>10/100 ha) (OR: 3.05; CI95%: 2.2-4.3), the presence of artificial waterholes (OR: 3.67; CI95%; 1.3-10.5) and the winter season (OR: 3.30; CI95%: 1.9-5.8). Campylobacter infection is widespread in wild boar populations in southern Spain. These findings suggest that wild artiodactyls, particularly wild boar, constitute a reservoir of Campylobacter species, including resistant and multi-resistant strains, which may be of public health concern.

White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are important secondary hosts for the cattle fever ticks, Rhipicephalus (B.) annulatus and Rhipicephalus (B.) microplus. White-tailed deer are capable of sustaining Boophilus spp. tick populations in the presence or absence of cattle. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of Babesia bovis and Babesia bigemina and the prevalence of antibodies to them and identify possible risk factors for bovine babesiosis in white-tailed deer in 3 northeastern states of Mexico. Whole blood and serum samples (n = 457) were collected from white-tailed deer in the states of Coahuila. Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas during the spring of 2004. Samples were tested for B. bovis and B. bigemina by nested polymerase chain reaction (n-PCR) (the primers for B. bovis identified the gene Rap-1 and B. bigemina were specific primers) and by an indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT). A questionnaire was given to each ranch to obtain information about management practices. Logistic regression methods were used to test the association between management factors and the dependent variable of positive n-PCR or IFAT. Nineteen (4.2%) samples were positive to B. bigemina and 6 (1.7%) were positive to B. bovis by n-PCR. Serological testing showed 59.9% (n = 274) of deer sampled were positive to B. bovis and 5.4% (n=25) were positive to B. bigemina antibodies. The logistic model varied with different dependent variables. With positive n-PCR and B. bigemina as the dependent variable, 3 factors were associated: habitat (presence of brush and exotic grasses; odds ratio (OR), 3.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.3-8.5), grazing system (continuous grazing OR 4.0; Cl, 1.3-12.2). and tick treatment frequency (3-4 mo; OR 7.0, CI 1.4-34.3; 5-6 mo; OR, 11.0; Cl, 1.9-62.7; >6 mo; OR, 4.6; Cl, 0.9-23.3). These findings suggest that white-tailed deer may act as a reservoir for the 2 bovine Babesia spp. and that white-tailed deer may be important in the epidemiology of babesiosis. However, evidence is not available to support whether white-tailed deer are, or are not, likely to be a host that could complete the transmission cycle of Babesia spp. These results Suggest that additional research is needed to demonstrate the importance of white-tailed deer as a Babesia spp. infection source for ticks."			<Go to ISI>://BCI:BCI200900489728

The Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), seroprevalence detected in wild boar from Area 1, was significantly higher before the disposal of big game hunting by-products (82.8%; 2008/2009-2012/2013) compared to the second period (61.8%; 2013/2014-2016/2017) (p<.001), after this control measure became established. By contrast, no significant differences between periods were found in wild boar (41.3% versus 44.8%; p=.33) and red deer (14.9% versus 11.6%; p=.19) from Area 2 as well as in red deer (10.8% versus 10.5%; p=.48) from Area 1. The proper disposal of hunting waste contributed to achieve a 25% reduction in MTC seroprevalence in wild boar. These results are of particular relevance regarding wild boar in the current context of re-emerging and emerging diseases such as TB and African Swine Fever in Europe. Further studies are needed to assess the effect of this measure on the health status of livestock and other wildlife species."

To better understand the pathogenic mechanisms of OSD, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of 11 strains of C. pseudotuberculosis isolated from different buffalo found to be infected in Egypt during an outbreak that occurred in 2008. Sixteen previously described pathogenicity islands (PiCp) were present in all of the new buffalo strains, but one of them, PiCp12, had an insertion that contained both a corynephage and a diphtheria toxin gene, both of which may play a role in the adaptation of C. pseudotuberculosis to this new host. Synteny analysis showed variations in the site of insertion of the corynephage during the same outbreak. A gene functional comparison showed the presence of a nitrate reductase operon that included genes involved in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis, which is necessary for a positive nitrate reductase phenotype and is a possible adaptation for intracellular survival. Genomes from the buffalo strains also had fusions in minor pilin genes in the spaA and spaD gene cluster (spaCX and spaYEF), which could suggest either an adaptation to this particular host, or mutation events in the immediate ancestor before this particular epidemic. A phylogenomic analysis confirmed a clear separation between the Ovis and Equi biovars, but also showed what appears to be a clustering by host species within the Equi strains."

Minas Gerais state is the third largest producer of goat milk in Brazil. Paratuberculosis is a chronic intestinal disease that mostly affects ruminants and can become a public health problem due to the possible association with Crohn's disease. It is transmitted by ingesting Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) contaminated food or water. In recent years, with the development of molecular techniques, the disease has been identified with greater precision and more quickly. MAP strains (S-Sheep, Cattle-C and B-Bison) have also been typed. The detection of a circulating MAP strain in a herd is important to develop epidemiological studies and thus establish better strategies to control paratuberculosis. This study aimed to identify and type MAP in dairy goat farms in the Zona da Mata, the main producing region of Minas ""Gerais state, Brazil. Feces and milk samples of 467 animals were collected, processed, inoculated in Herrold's Egg Yolk Agar (HEYM) and submitted to PCR and REA techniques. Eleven (2.36%) animals were positive for the presence of MAP in four properties and the isolates were characterized as type C strain. It was concluded that MAP is present in dairy goats from properties in Zona da Mata, MG and that strain type C circulates in the area. This is the first report of MAP typing isolated from dairy goat in Brazil. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."			<Go to ISI>://BCI:BCI201600703784

Antibodies against N. caninum were determined in sera of 449 water buffaloes by using an indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). A Bayesian logistic regression mixed model was used to quantify the strength of association between positive serological results to N. caninum and gender, age and category (calf, steer, heifer, cow) as risk factors. Antibody titers were found in 287 (64%) buffaloes. All ranches had seropositive animals. Age was more strongly associated with positive results to N. caninum (OR: 1.4; Cl 95%: 0.86-2.22) than gender (OR: 1.02, CI 95%: 0.40-2.59) and category (OR: 0.88, CI 95%: 0.57-0.88).

Pozio"	2007	Molecular identification of Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia duodenalis in the Italian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis)		Veterinary Parasitology			150		2-Jan	146-149					30-Nov			Molecular identification of Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia duodenalis in the Italian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis)		0304-4017												BCI:BCI200800076905				"Livestock are commonly infected with protozoan parasites of the genera Cryptosporidium and Giardia, and some of the species and genotypes found in these animals have zoonotic significance. We characterized isolates of both parasites recovered from the Italian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), an economically important species whose milk is used for the production of ""buffalo mozzarella"" fresh cheese. Molecular analysis of the Cryptosporidium small subunit ribosomal DNA gene and of the Giardia beta-giardin gene shows the presence of both zoonotic parasites (Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia duodenalis assemblage A) and host-specific parasites (G. duodenalis assemblage E), suggesting that water buffaloes can contribute to environmental contamination with oocysts and cysts potentially infectious to humans if their faeces are improperly disposed of. On the other hand, mozzarella cheese is probably a safe product, given that its production involves the treatment of cheese curd at 85-95 degrees C, which is likely to kill or inactivate the parasites.

Pozio"	2008	Multilocus genotyping of Giardia duodenalis reveals striking differences between assemblages A and B		International Journal for Parasitology			38		13	1523-1531					Nov			Multilocus genotyping of Giardia duodenalis reveals striking differences between assemblages A and B		0020-7519												BCI:BCI200900031287				"Giardia duodenalis is a widespread parasite of mammalian species. including humans. Due to its invariant morphology, investigations of aspects such as host specificity and transmission patterns require the direct genetic characterisation of parasites from faecal samples. We performed a sequence analysis of four genes (ssrRNA, beta-giardin, glutamate dehydrogenase and triose phosphate isomerase) of 61 human isolates and 29 animal isolates. The results showed that multilocus genotypes (MLGs) can be readily defined for G. duodenalis isolates of assemblage A but not for assemblage B. Indeed, for assemblage A isolates, there was no evidence of intra-isolate sequence heterogeneity, and congruent genotyping results were obtained at the four genetic loci investigated. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis showed that human-derived and animal-derived MLGs are different, and further indicated the presence of a new sub-assemblage (referred to as ""AIII""), which was found exclusively in wild hoofed animals. On the other hand, there were variable levels of intra-isolate sequence heterogeneity (i.e., the presence of two overlapping nucleotide peaks at specific positions in the chromatograms, or ""heterogeneous templates"") in assemblage B isolates from humans and animals, and this prevented the unambiguous identification of MLGs. Furthermore, in five human isolates and one non-human primate isolate, the assignment to assemblage B was problematic, given that one of the four markers supported an assignment to assemblage A. These findings raise concerns about the interpretation of genotyping data based on single markers, and indicate the need to understand the mechanisms that are responsible for the differences between G. duodenalis assemblages A and B.

The disease is characterized by variable degrees of cachexia, alopecia and neurological manifestations prior to death. The aim of this study was to investigate this disease under experimental conditions. To assess viral virulence, humoral immune response, dissemination and probable routes of transmission, seven chamois (five seronegative and two seropositive for BDV) were inoculated with a BDV isolated from a naturally infected chamois. A group of three chamois were maintained as uninfected controls. The five seronegative chamois became viraemic from day 2 post-inoculation (p.i.) until their death (three animals) or the end of the experiment (on day 34 p.i.) and developed neutralizing antibodies from day 18 p.i. until the end of the study. Continuous shedding of the virus was detected by RT-PCR in oral, nasal and rectal swabs in viraemic chamois from day 5 p.i. Despite none of the viraemic chamois showing obvious neurological signs, all of them had a non-suppurative meningoencephalitis as seen in naturally infected chamois. The two inoculated BDV-seropositive chamois did not become viraemic. This study confirms that BDV is the primary agent of the disease that has been affecting chamois populations in recent years in the Pyrenees and that previously acquired humoral immunity is protective."
